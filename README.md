I’m a Master’s student in Data Science at Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences, actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my passion for data, AI, and analytics to solve meaningful real-world problems. With a strong foundation in mathematics and hands-on experience across the data science pipeline, I bring both analytical depth and practical expertise to the table.

During my time at Boehringer Ingelheim as a Data Scientist Co-op, I designed and deployed end-to-end machine learning solutions that addressed key business challenges. This included building a time series forecasting platform for sales data, developing a document comparison system using LLMs to streamline FDA submission reviews, and implementing a secure, scalable RAG-based chatbot for knowledge retrieval from 700-page documents. I also automated IT vendor risk evaluation and built self-serve ML workflows integrating MLflow, Databricks, and Streamlit.

Earlier, as an Analyst at Cognizant Technology Solutions, I built real-time dashboards, optimized data pipelines handling 150,000+ records, and improved decision-making efficiency through streamlined SQL workflows and BI tooling.

At Northeastern, my academic focus includes machine learning, NLP, cloud computing, and large language models. I’m especially interested in building intelligent, scalable systems that empower data-driven decisions.

I’m eager to join a collaborative team where I can contribute to solving complex problems, continue learning, and grow as a data scientist. Let’s connect—whether to explore opportunities, exchange ideas, or collaborate on something impactful.
