I'm a Master's student in Data Science at Northeastern University - Khoury College of Computer Sciences, deeply invested in the intersection of data, technology, and analytics. My journey began with an undergraduate degree in Mathematics, laying a solid foundation for my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities. This mathematical background, when fused with my current studies and practical experiences in data science, uniquely positions me in the field.

During my tenure at Cognizant Technology Solutions as a Programmer Analyst for over two years, I developed a robust set of skills , My role involved tackling complex problems and contributing to solutions that enhanced business efficiency. 

In my academic pursuits at Northeastern, I am deepening my expertise in areas such as machine learning, predictive modeling, and data analysis. I am particularly fascinated by the power of data to drive decision-making and innovation. My goal is to leverage these skills in a role that challenges me to apply both my mathematical rigor and data science knowledge to solve real-world problems. I look forward to connecting with professionals and leaders in the field. 

Whether itâ€™s to discuss the latest in data science, explore potential collaborations, or share opportunities, I am open to meaningful conversations and connections.
