Hello, 

I’m Varsha Ranganathan, a Master’s student in Data Science at Northeastern University, blending a strong mathematical foundation with hands-on tech industry experience from my time as a Programmer Analyst at Cognizant Technology Solutions. Passionate about Machine Learning, I aim to leverage my skills in Python, R, SQL, and data visualization for impactful data-driven decision-making. My academic prowess is highlighted by my capstone project, a unique word cloud visualization of death row offenders’ last statements, demonstrating my ability to extract insights from complex data. Outside academia, I find solace and inspiration in reading books, which sharpens my cognitive skills. Reach out to me at ranganathan.va@northeastern.edu for discussions or collaborations in data science.
